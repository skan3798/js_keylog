	<p> Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
		proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
		you very much. They were the last people you’d expect to be
		involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just
		didn’t hold with such nonsense. Mr Dursley was the director of a fi rm called Grunnings,
		which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly
		any neck, although he did have a very large moustache.
		Mrs Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the
		usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent
		so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the
		neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and
		in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere. </p>
